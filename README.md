# ArcNode

This project is a simplified React-like UI library implemented in pure JavaScript. It includes the core concepts of components, state management, and a virtual DOM with a diffing algorithm.

## Features

- Component-based architecture
- State management
- Virtual DOM and diffing algorithm
- Dynamic rendering and nested components

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this project, you'll need:

- A web browser
- A local web server (optional, for better experience)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/arwysyah/ArcNode.git

   ```

### Running the Project

1. Excecute the command below:

3. **(Optional) Serve the project using a local web server:**

   If you prefer running the project with a local web server, you can use tools like [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server).

   **Using `http-server`:**

   - Install `http-server` globally (if not already installed):

     ```bash
     npm install -g http-server
     ```

   - Start the server in the project directory:

     ```bash
     http-server

   - Run and start
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

## Note

This library is a work-in-progress and not yet complete. It aims to mimic some of React's functionality using pure JavaScript. Some features may be incomplete or not fully tested. Use it for educational purposes or for experimentation.
